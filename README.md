# xzibit
A documentation and deep dive into rabbit hole of Spotify developer and testing accounts, codenamed "xzibit".

### Short Explanation
The developers of Spotify need a way to test their products, services, and other things on a production environment. They are able to do this with testing accounts, AKA accounts that are only meant for developer usage and not meant for the public eye. But, people (like me) have stumbled upon these testing accounts and seen a great deal of interesting, funny, and downright confusing content that the developers of Spotify use as testing material. This repository goes into detail on 15+ developer accounts that have been found, providing an easy to read library of content that explains what goes on behind the scenes at Spotify.

### Account List
- **[Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/artist/5UUG83KSlqPhrBssrducWV?si=bleAKkEIR9u_J7ybWMnsPA)** - Is linked to theoretically every single user-curated playlist, and has ties to every single other account in this list.
- **[Snoffer Pan](https://open.spotify.com/artist/4u7ykrc9zhpirg2IeWYCZM?si=f5xxM3JdTb-4PIaBKJLaTw)** - Has an album titled *"Rathbroom Dallabs"*, which contains only songs from the developer *"Spotify"* account. Also has a strage Shopify integration with equally strange products. Was the first account I found, thus being the key to accessing every other account in this list.
- **[FCACA Test 1](https://open.spotify.com/artist/5kCyuPZD3YexBCH97hhNQ1?si=j-1tpVfmTKCG8Q2_2HOUCg)** - Just a boring blatant test account. Has one album titled *"Automatic Tests Content"* with the 2 classic hits *"Do not use this test artist"* and *"It's used for test runs"*.
- **[FMHanabiSyntheticTests](https://open.spotify.com/artist/45GYBqIbLMscUGishh8dIf)** - Another test account containing songs from

What do all those have in common?

**They're all never before seen, uncovered developer accounts.** These were all uncovered in one night, by me. They contain extremely strange sights, such as:

* The same 50 second audio file on 100+ songs across 10+ accounts
* A $51,000 antique clock
* Free Alpacas
* So-called "NFT Tests"
* Remixes of Spotify team members talking to each other as EDM songs
* Ties to a hidden developer group known as XZIBit

And **MUCH MORE!**

All of these are public and available to the public. I will be making an *extensive* documentation on these accounts tomorrow on my GitHub, as it's late right now. ^(Praying that they don't get taken down!)

I hope you all enjoy my very interesting finds, and have fun digging around the profiles! Feel free to leave all findings in the replies below. If you already have information on these accounts, let me know too so I can update my post.
